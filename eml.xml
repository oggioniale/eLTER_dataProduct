    <abstract>The primary goal of this project is to determine
  experimentally the amount of lead time required to prevent a state
  change. To achieve this goal, we will (1) experimentally induce state
  changes in a natural aquatic ecosystem - the Sarracenia microecosystem;
  (2) use proteomic analysis to identify potential indicators of states
  and state changes; and (3) test whether we can forestall state changes
  by experimentally intervening in the system. This work uses state-of-the
  art molecular tools to identify early warning indicators in the field
  of aerobic to anaerobic state changes driven by nutrient enrichment
  in an aquatic ecosystem. The study tests two general hypotheses: (1)
  proteomic biomarkers can function as reliable indicators of impending
  state changes and may give early warning before increasing variances
  and statistical flickering of monitored variables; and (2) well-timed
  intervention based on proteomic biomarkers can avert future state changes
  in ecological systems.</abstract>

    Field methods. All experiments will be carried out in the
  greenhouse at Harvard Forest. We have developed an instrumentation
  system that allows us to collect continuous dissolved [O2]
  measurements: dedicated micro-probes (DO-166MT; Lazar Research
                                        Laboratories: http://www.shelfscientific.com/) connected to
  multiplexers and data loggers (AM16/32B multiplexer, CR-1000
                                 datalogger and control system [Campbell Scientific:
                                                                  http://www.cambellsci.com]). The initial ecosystem composition in
  all experimental plants will be standardized by seeding each
  pitcher with a 10-ml inoculum of liquid collected from pitchers
  growing at Tom Swamp. In all experiments, prey will be supplied to
  pitchers as standardized aliquots of dried and finely ground
  bald-faced hornets (Dolichovespula maculata; Hymenoptera:
                        Vespidae), which we collect in quantity throughout New England.
  Both hornets and ants (the latter are the dominant prey of S.
                         purpurea) are hymenoptera, and have nearly identical C:N ratios
  (hornets: 3.97; common bog-dwelling ants [Tapinoma sessile and
                                            Myrmica lobifrons]: 3.37), but on average hornets have greater
  than 100 times the dry mass of these ants, and are easier to
  collect and process as a standardized food source. Additions of
  prey, either as large <quote>pulses</quote> or chronic
  <quote>presses</quote> are analogous to the enrichment and
  eutrophication that occur in aquatic <quote>green</quote> food
  webs in which phytoplankton abundance is boosted through addition
  of limiting nutrients. In <quote>brown</quote> food webs such as
  the Sarracenia microecosystem, detritus - not primary production -
    is at the base of the web, and our treatments boost this material
  as would happen through increases in arthropod prey capture78 or
  through nitrogen-enriched precipitation.

    <para>
    Proteomic analysis. Proteomic profiles of microbial communities
  are determined after separating the microbial fraction from the
  pitcher fluid, prey, and other detritus. The microbial
  <quote>pellet</quote> is subjected to SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl
                                                  sulfate polyacrylamide gel) electrophoresis; bands are cut out and
  digested in-gel with trypsin. Tryptic peptides are subjected to
  LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry) for
  peptide and protein identification. Absolute abundance of peptides
  and proteins are quantified using AQUA (Absolute QUAntification)
  analysis109.

    <title>Specific Experiments</title>
    <para>
    Experiment #1. Effects of nutrient enrichment on state changes and
  [O2] profiles. This experiment alters nutrient enrichment rates to
  characterize the [O2] profile and the transition to the anaerobic
  state. The experimental design is a one-way layout with 5
  treatment groups: one control (no enrichment) and 4 enrichment
  levels (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mg prey added ml-1 d-1). One plant
  is assigned to each treatment group, and the entire set is
  replicated 6 times over successive weeks. [O2] is monitored
  continuously for 4 days to characterize state changes and tipping
  points under different enrichment rates. This experiment tracks a
  continuous [O2] profile but does not include proteomic analysis.
  The purpose of Experiment #1 is to identify an enrichment rate E
  that generates a long pre-tipping period before transition time T
  to the anaerobic state. This enrichment rate will be used in
  Experiments #2 - #4.
  </para>
    <para>
    Experiment #2. Identification of early intervention time and
  characterization of aerobic and anaerobic proteomes. This
  experiment will use the single enrichment rate E determined from
  Experiment #1 and impose different intervention times I at which
  nutrient enrichment will be terminated. Thus, this experiment will
  identify the latest time I* at which it is possible to intervene
  and stop the transition to the anaerobic state by halting
  enrichment. The [O2] profile will again be monitored continuously
  over 10 days to measure the state of the system. From Experiment
  #1, the transition time T to the anaerobic state with no
  intervention will be known. We will use one control group (no prey
                                                             addition) and ten levels of intervention time (all with the same
                                                                                                            enrichment rate E) as a proportion of T (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5,
                                                                                                                                                     0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0). Six plants will be assigned randomly to
  each of the 11 treatments in a randomized one-way layout and [O2]
  profiles will be monitored continuously. In addition to the [O2]
  profiles, we will also characterize the protein profiles of
  aerobic and anaerobic pitchers in all 11 treatment groups at the
  end of the experiment.
  </para>
    <para>
    After the plants are harvested, we will create proteomic profiles
  of the predominantly bacterial portion (centrifuged pellet) of the
  pitcher fluid from each plant, as described in General Protocols.
  Thus, 66 separate pellet-fraction samples will be analyzed by
  SDS-PAGE. After examining the SDS-PAGE profiles, approximately ten
  proteins that show dynamic patterns consistent with state change
  and five that do not change will be cut from the gel, subjected to
  in-gel tryptic digestion and a portion of the tryptic peptides
  will be analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Using these data, we will choose
  three identified peptides from each protein for peptide synthesis
  such that each synthesized peptide contains stable isotope labels
  (AQUA peptides) to distinguish them by mass from the native
  peptides. We will then quantify all 45 of the native peptides from
  the original samples using a known amount of each AQUA peptide
  spiked into the tryptic digest. The AQUA analysis of proteins that
  do not show changes will be used for normalization between
  samples. These data will be used to independently identify the
  current state of the system and forecast the time-to-transition.
  </para>
    <para>
    We will use Sequest searches for initial identification of
  peptides; relevant scores including Xcorr and Delta Cn values will
  be given for each peptide. Other peptides will be identified by de
  novo sequencing using PepNovo; all PepNovo scores will likewise be
  given including any N- or C-terminal gaps. Mass error in ppm will
  be reported for each precursor ion. We will use standard
  multivariate analysis to search for distinctive proteomic
  profiles114 that characterize aerobic and anaerobic ecosystems, as
  well as ecosystems that developed with and without inputs of
  photosynthetic O2 and plant metabolites.
  </para>
    <para>
    Experiment #3. Identification of diagnostic proteins. Using
  Experiments #1 and 2, we will have identified an enrichment rate E
  with a long pre-tipping period and an intervention time I* before
  which mitigation and termination of enrichment will prevent
  eutrophication. Experiment #3 will characterize the mean and
  variance of the protein profile before and after I*. We are
  especially interested in identifying proteins that increase
  rapidly in abundance (or variance) well before the onset of
  flickering in [O2] and before the transition time T from the
  aerobic to the anaerobic state.
  </para>
    <para>
    A cohort of 100 plants all will be fed at rate E (determined from
                                                      Experiment #1), with intervention time I* determined from
                                                      Experiment #2, although no intervention will be used in this
                                                      <quote>press</quote> experiment so that we can contrast proteins
                                                      before and after the state change. At seven times before I* and
                                                      three times after I<emphasis>, we will harvest 10 randomly chosen
                                                      plants. At each prescribed harvest time, we will measure [O2] and
                                                      collect samples from each plant for proteomic screening using both
                                                      SDS-PAGE and AQUA analysis. This experiment will identify proteins
                                                      that rise quickly in abundance during the pre- I</emphasis> period
                                                      and can be used as early indicators of a future tipping point.
                                                      Because different plants will be harvested at each time period,
                                                      this is a one-way ANOVA design, with pre-and post- I* a priori
                                                      contrasts. A randomization test will be used to determine whether
                                                      variances in protein expression differ through time. During these
                                                      analyses we will use the data from the AQUA peptides and from
                                                      known amounts of protein standards, such as bovine serum albumin,
                                                      to approximate the amount of protein in a given coomassie-stained
                                                      SDS-PAGE gel band. The reason for doing this is to provide a fast
                                                      <quote>real-time</quote> assay based just on expression in the
                                                      SDS-PAGE. This rapid assay will be used in Experiment #4.

                                                      a benchmark test of our methods and their ability to correctly
                                                      identify tipping points. A cohort of 100 plants will each be
                                                      fitted with [O2] probes and started on the enrichment regime. Two
                                                      times per day, we will collect 3 plants each, pool their contents,
                                                      and conduct a rapid screen in the lab with SDS-PAGE for the
                                                      diagnostic proteins that were identified in Experiment #3. We will
                                                      use the protein expression in the gel to delineate an

                                                      strategy. As soon as diagnostic proteins measured in the SDS-gels
                                                      are at abundances that signal we are at 0.5×I* - approximately
                                                      one-half of the way to the latest intervention time - we will
                                                      randomly select one third of the remaining plants for mitigation
                                                      and termination of enrichment (the <quote>early</quote> mitigation
                                                                                     strategy). We will continue to harvest plants from the remainder
                                                      of the cohort and monitor proteins. As soon as diagnostic proteins
                                                      signal we are at 0.75 times I*, we will randomly select one half
                                                      of the remaining plants for mitigation and termination of
                                                      enrichment (the <quote>late</quote> mitigation strategy). The
                                                      remaining plants (approximately one sixth to one third of the
                                                                        original cohort) will continue to be enriched. We will monitor
                                                      [O2] in all 3 groups (no-mitigation control, early mitigation,

                                                      the protein markers are successful, the proportion of food webs
                                                      that remain aerobic will be significantly higher in the two
                                                      mitigation treatments than in the no-mitigation control.
